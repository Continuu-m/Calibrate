## alembic/versions/

This folder stores all your migration files.
Each file represents one change to your database schema.

Alembic generates these automatically when you run:
    alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description of change"

### Migration Chain
Migrations form a linked list — each one knows its parent:
    None → a1b2c3 → d4e5f6 → g7h8i9 (current)

### Never manually edit generated migration files
Unless you know exactly what you're doing. Alembic tracks
revision IDs and manual edits can break the chain.
